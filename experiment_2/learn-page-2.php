				<p>Writers use words and phrases to organize their ideas in an opinion piece.</p>
				<ul class="medium-12 lesson-items" style="margin-left:0; padding-right:12px">
				  <li>Sometimes, words can be used to organize information based upon its order, or the sequence and 
				  amount of information. For example, a writer may organize their ideas with words like, “First”, “Next”, “Then” or “Finally”.</li>
				  <li>Phrases can be used to organize ideas based on their importance, or how much special attention the information deserves.
				   For example, a writer may organize their ideas with phrases like, “Most importantly”, or “Above all”.</li>
